# Diacritics Removal

---

## English

### Description
Diacritics Removal is a lightweight web tool designed to process text by removing diacritics (accents), special characters, and replacing spaces with hyphens. It's perfect for generating clean URLs, standardized filenames, or simplified text.

### How It Works
1. Enter your text in the input field (e.g., "What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?").
2. Click the "Convert" button to process the text.
3. View the result (e.g., "What-is-Rheumatoid-Arthritis").
4. Click "Copy" to copy the result to your clipboard—a "Text copied!" message will appear for 2 seconds.

### Features
- Removes diacritics (e.g., á → a, é → e)
- Strips special characters (e.g., ?, !, ., etc.)
- Converts spaces to hyphens (-)
- Includes a copy-to-clipboard feature

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
